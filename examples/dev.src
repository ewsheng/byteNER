Beclin localizes to the TGN. HeLa (A, D, E and F), BNL CL.2 (B) and H‐4‐II‐E cells (C) were grown on cover slips. Cells were permeabilized with digitonin before (C, D and E) or after (A, B and F) fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde. Cells were double‐labeled with anti‐Beclin (A-F, left panels) and either anti‐syntaxin 6 (A and B, middle panels), anti‐TGN38 (C, middle panel), anti‐EEA1 (D, middle panel), anti‐LBPA (E, middle panel) or anti‐TfR (F, middle panel) antibodies. In the merged images (right panels), yellow indicates co‐localization. Bar, 10 μm.
Immunofluorescence localization of PtdIns 3‐kinase. HeLa (A and C) and H‐4‐II‐E cells (B) were permeabilized, fixed, and then subjected to immunostaining. Cells were double‐labeled with anti‐PtdIns 3‐kinase (A-C, left panels) and either anti‐syntaxin 6 (A, middle panel), anti‐TGN38 (B, middle panel) or anti‐LBPA (C, middle panel) antibodies. Bar, 10 μm.
(A) After 4 h of starvation in 1% K‐acetate medium in the presence of PMSF, autophagic vesicles can be visualized in vacuoles of wild‐type and pep4prb1 cells using Normaski optics. In aut2Δ and aut7Δ cells no autophagic vesicles can be seen. Bar represents 20 μm.
(B) Total protein breakdown of cells starved on nitrogen‐free medium is significantly reduced in aut2Δ andaut7Δ cells compared with wild‐type cells. pep4Δ (pra1Δ) cells are almost completely impaired in starvation‐induced vacuolar protein breakdown. Cells were pulse‐labeled with [35S]methionine and chased on non‐radioactive starvation medium. Aliquots were taken at the indicated times and acid soluble small peptides generated by proteolysis were determined according to Straub et al. (1997).
