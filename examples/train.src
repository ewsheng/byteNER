(A) Cell lysates prepared from HeLa cells were solubilized with Triton X-100 and subjected to immunoprecipitation using preimmune sera (lane 1) or anti-Beclin antibodies (lanes 2 and 3). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with phosphatidylinositol, [γ-32P]ATP and 60 μM cold ATP in the presence of Mn2+ (lanes 1 and 2) or Mg2+ (lane 3) for 5 min at 30°C.
(B) Immunoprecipitates of anti‐Beclin antibodies prepared as described in (A) were assayed for PI 3‐kinase activity in the presence of wortmannin at concentrations of 0 nM (lane 1), 1 nM (lane 2), 10 nM (lane 3), 100 nM (lane 4). The labeled lipids were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography, followed by detection by autoradiography using a bioimaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film).
(C) Cell lysates prepared from HeLa cells were solubilized with Triton X‐100 and incubated with protein A‐immobilized anti‐Beclin (lane 2) or anti‐PtdIns 3‐kinase antibodies (lane 4). As controls, preimmune sera of the respective antibodies (lanes 1 and 3) were used. Retained proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti‐PtdIns 3‐kinase (upper panels) and anti‐Beclin (lower panels) antibodies.
(A) Total cell lysates were treated with DSP (lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8) or its solvent, dimethylsulfoxide (lanes 1, 2, 5 and 6), at 4°C for 2 h. Proteins were solubilized with SDS and subjected to immunoprecipitation using protein A‐immobilized anti‐PtdIns 3‐kinase (PtdIns 3‐K) (lanes 1-4) or Beclin (lanes 5-8) antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were eluted with 1× SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, a trace amount of Bromophenol blue). After treatment with 5% 2‐mercaptoethanol, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by detection by immunoblotting with anti‐Beclin (upper panels) and anti‐PtdIns 3‐kinase (lower panels) antibodies.
(B) Cell lysates prepared from HeLa cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation by centrifugation at 100 000 g for 1 h. The membrane (lanes 1 and 3) and supernatant (lanes 2 and 4) fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti‐PtdIns 3‐kinase (lanes 1 and 2) and anti‐Beclin (lanes 3 and 4) antibodies.
(C) Membrane (lanes 1-4; 100 000 g, 30 min, pellet) and soluble fractions (lanes 5-8; 100 000 g, 30 min, supernatant) prepared from HeLa cells were treated with DSP (lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8) or dimethylsulfoxide (lanes 1, 2, 5 and 6). Proteins were solubilized with SDS and subjected to immunoprecipitation using protein A-immobilized anti-PtdIns 3-kinase antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE under a reducing condition, followed by detection by immunoblotting with Beclin antibodies. F and E indicate flow-through and elute fracions, respectively.
(B) Affinity chromatography confirms protein-protein interaction between Aut2p and Aut7p. A fusion protein of Aut2p with the 26 kDa glutathione‐S‐transferase (GST) domain from Schistosoma japonicum (see Materials and methods) was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. This GST-Aut2p column was incubated with a crude extract from aut7Δ cen Met25::AUT7-GFP cells. The non‐bound supernatant (S) fraction (lane 1) was taken away. Gel beads were successively washed with NaCl solutions of increasing concentrations to remove non‐specifically bound proteins. After the final 500 mM NaCl wash (W, lane 2), bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer (E, lane 3). Samples were analyzed in immunoblots with monoclonal antibodies directed against GFP. Using Aut2p-GST, a clear band corresponding to Aut7p-GFP is seen in the eluate fraction (lane 3, arrowhead). As a control, GST alone was attached to the column and no band was detectable (lane 6).
