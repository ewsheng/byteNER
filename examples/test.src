(C) As described in (B), bovine tubulin binds to GST-Aut2pglutathione-Sepharose 4B (lane 12), but not to GSTglutathione-Sepharose 4B (lane 9). Protein staining with Coomassie is shown in lanes 1-6; in lanes 7-12 tubulin was detected using monoclonal antibodies (Boehringer Mannheim). Further details are given in Materials and methods.
(D) Similar to (C), bovine tubulin does not bind to GST-Aut7pglutathione-Sepharose 4B (lane 12) and to GSTglutathione-Sepharose 4B (lane 9). Lanes 1-6, protein staining with Coomassie; lanes 7-12 probed with antibodies directed against tubulin.
Benomyl sensitivity of wild‐type cells overexpressing AUT2 and AUT7, and of aut2Δ and aut7Δ cells is not altered. Cells were grown to stationary phase and dilution series with decreasing cell densites were dropped on CM plates without uracil containing 15 and 30 μg/ml benomyl. Plates were incubated at 30°C.
(A) Autophagosome‐like vesicles (arrowhead) are accumulating in the cytoplasm of aut2Δ cells starved for 4 h on 1% K‐acetate in the presence of PMSF. Bar represents 100 nm.
